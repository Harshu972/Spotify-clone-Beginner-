This is a basic spotify clone made with the refrence taken from code with harry youtube channel.
In this project there are 2 folders named as covers and songs as name suggest it contains the songs ans their cover art.
I used HTML,CSS,JavaScript to make this project as the file suggest index.HTML, style.CSS and script.js.
I have given the full functional seekbar with the icons taken from the Font Awesome website and the auto next song play functionality with play pause and next previous song features.
